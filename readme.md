# pyRavenMatrices

*Raven's Progressive Matrices* are a family of intelligence tests. They are 
notable for having a simple visual multiple-choice format and are considered 
to be a good tool for measuring abilities such as inductive reasoning, fluid 
reasoning, and (to a lesser extent) general intelligence in humans.

This package aims to provide an open source, extensible, and easy-to-use 
`python` library for representing and generating (large quantities of) custom 
problems in the style of Raven's Matrices for research in artificial 
intelligence and cognitive science.

## Dependencies

- `python` version >= 3.6.0.
- `cairo`, a 2D vector graphics library written in `C`. 
- `pycairo`, `python` bindings for `cairo`.
